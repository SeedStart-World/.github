🌟 **SeedStart.world – Track Your Startup’s Journey & Shine for Investors** 🚀
SeedStart.world is building the go-to platform where early-stage founders can **log progress, form committed teams, earn recognition**, and showcase traction to investors. We believe real execution beats slideware, and every effort your team logs should boost your chances of success and funding.

## 🌱 Our Mission

* **Progress, not promises** – capture weekly wins, milestones, and learnings
* **Team-formation with accountability** – founders, engineers, designers, and product minds commit in public
* **Reputation & rewards** – earn “SeedPoints” for meaningful contributions; unlock perks, mentorship, and equity pools
* **Investor-ready dashboards** – share a live snapshot of KPIs, traction graphs, and team résumés with one secure link

Over the next 90 days we’re laser-focused on:

1. Shipping our private alpha (milestone & team ledger, SeedPoints engine)
2. On-boarding 10 pilot startups
3. Publishing the first public “SeedStart Leaderboard” to catch investor eyes

Help us reach these goals and shape the product from day one!

We’re 100 % volunteer-driven until funding lands, so we’re looking for **experienced hands** who can guide juniors while still shipping code/design/roadmaps themselves.

## 🎓 Apprenticeship (Internship) Track – \$25/week

Aspiring Software Engineers, UI/UX Designers, or Product Analysts: join our **8- to 12-week hands-on apprenticeship**. You’ll pair with a Lead, tackle scoped user stories, and finish with a portfolio-ready project and a SeedStart certification.

| Program Snapshot | Details                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Cadence**      | Minimum 3 meetings per week                                              |
| **Time**         | 10 hrs/week (remote, flexible)                                           |
| **Curriculum**   | React + TypeScript / Figma & prototyping / Agile roadmapping             |
| **Support**      | Daily Discord Q\&A, code reviews, weekly feedback loops                  |
| **Outcome**      | Certificate, LinkedIn recommendation, potential promotion to contributor |
| **Fee**          | **\$25 per week** (covers platform, tooling, & mentor time)              |

Your small weekly fee serves a double purpose: it covers for our mentoring effort, and (like a gym membership) because you’ve paid, you’re more likely to stick with the program.
